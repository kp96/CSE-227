    *  Host:Port is a primary key, only one entry per host:port can exist.
    *  The implementation will store a fingerprint of the cert.
    *  The implementation will decide which fingerprint alg is used.
    *
+   *  Each override is specific to exactly the errors overridden, so
+   *  overriding everything won't match certs at the given host:port
+   *  which only exhibit some subset of errors.

    *  @param aPort The port this mapping belongs to, if it is -1 then it 
    *          is internaly treated as 443
    *  @param aCert The cert that should always be accepted
-   *  @param aOverrideBits The errors we want to be overriden
