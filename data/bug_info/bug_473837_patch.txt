As a preparation for the NSS dependency fix,
push patch from bug 474473 (independently of a NSS tag).

Tree will remain in this state only for minutes.
Then update to a new NSS tag, which includes above fix,
(and touch the coreconf.dep file to force rebuilding
all of NSS):

python client.py update_nss NSS_3_12_3_BETA2
hg addremove -n
hg commit -A
